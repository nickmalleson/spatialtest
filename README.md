# Andresen SpatialTest

The spatial point pattern test was developed as part of Martin Andresenâ€™s PhD Dissertation. The test measures the degree of similarity at the local level between two spatial point patterns and is an area-based test. The software has been written by Nick Malleson in Java and has a graphical user interface that can be used to run the test.
