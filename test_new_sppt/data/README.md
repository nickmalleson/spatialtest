The raw point data represent all offences that were recorded by the Metropolitan Police Service in London, UK, in April 2017 (‘points1.shp’) and May 2017 (‘points2.shp’). They are publicly available from [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/data/). The original csv files are included as well. The definition of the columns can be found on the original website: [data.police.uk/about/](https://data.police.uk/about/#general) (under 'CSV Columns').

The boundary data (‘london_lsoa.shp’) represent Lower Super Output Areas in Greater London. These were downloaded for all of England from [UKBORDERS](https://borders.ukdataservice.ac.uk/), and Greater London was then extracted. The data contain two fields: the unique LSOA code for each area, and a name.
