# Introduction to the SpatialTest Program #

The spatial point pattern test was developed as part of [Martin Andresen's](http://www.sfu.ca/~andresen/) PhD Dissertation. The test measures the degree of similarity at the local level between two spatial point patterns and is an area-based test. The software has been written by [Nick Malleson](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/n.malleson) in Java and has a graphical user interface that can be used to run the test.

See the [documentation](SpatialTestIntroduction.md) for more information.
